# rxjava-basics
This repository is based on a Course: Reactive Programming in Java using RXJava 3.x - ReactiveX -> https://www.udemy.com/course/reactive-programming-in-java-using-rxjava-3x-reactivex/

## About the course
This is a course where you will get to learn about an entirely new paradigm of programming "Reactive".
In the Modern age of applications where things are getting developed rapidly, We come across a lot of applications being launched almost every week.
This has become very difficult for businesses and application developers to make their applications stand out.
There are few things that developers need to think about even before starting the development and choosing the right architecture for their upcoming applications!
How the application will remain responsive even in case of extreme load?
How they will make the System more resilient - Even in case of error system should behave sensibly?
How they will make use of the resources in the most efficient manner?
How they will cope up with the increasing load.. or you may say elastic?
Reactive programming may be the answer to that.
Reactive programming and libraries like RxJava, Reactor are built and designed to keep all these things in mind.
In this course, we will understand Reactive Programming fundamentals and RxJava and its capability in deep.
And the best thing about this course is that our main focus will be the core concepts of RxJava.
RxJava comes with a lot of tools but before understanding and getting deep into them -
In the first section of the course, we will understand some fundamentals to make our learning of RxJava more sensible and easy to learn in upcoming sections!
- Reactive Manifesto
- Sync Vs Async
- Call Backs and Call BackHelll
- Push Vs Pull
- Concurrent Vs Parallel
- Observer Design pattern

Then the power of RxJava will start. We have a lot to cover in Deep

- Observable and Observers
- Operators
- Combining Observables
- Replaying Caching and Subjects
- Concurrency and Parallelism
- Buffering Throttling and Switching
- Flowable and BackPressure Implementation of Java reactive streams
- This Course also comes with two Bonus Sections of Java Streams.
